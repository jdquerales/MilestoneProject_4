## Stream Fourth Project: Full Stack Frameworks with Django Development - Code Institute

This is the fourth milestone project of my journey as a Software Developer in Code Institute. The aim of this project is to 
build a full-stack site based around business logic used to control a centrally-owned dataset. I will set up an authentication
mechanism and provide paid access to the site's data and/or other activities based on the dataset, such as the purchase of 
a product/service.
